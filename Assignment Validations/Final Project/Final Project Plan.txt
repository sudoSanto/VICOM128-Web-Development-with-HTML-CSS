Final Project Project Plan/Description
Who is the website for (topic, client and visitors) and define the goals of the web site

This website will be a showcase of my ITDEV110 final project as a portfolio accompaniment.  
It will display the main site in a fashion that mimics the outlay of the game’s main menu, 
using hover CSS to simulate cursor selection.

There will be five pages in total(main will have two pages).  The main menu will have a 
link to a Youtube video explaining the game.  Also, links to a description page about the 
game, a description page about the author and a contact page.  There will be a standard 
header with links for easy site navigation and continuity as well.  These links will be all 
the same links included on the main page sans the Youtube link.  The About the Author page 
will also include a gitHub link to the game’s code.

Visitors of the site will be any prospective employers or anyone interested in the game 
and/or the C# code it was made in.

The site will maintain 8-bit-esque graphics that mimic the console ASCII graphics the game 
was made in.  This will keep it playful, yet pertinent to the game.
