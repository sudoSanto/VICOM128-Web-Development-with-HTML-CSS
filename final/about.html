                <h2>C#alaga</h2>
                <p>
                    The game's name is a play on the Japanese arcade game, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaga" title="Galaga - Wikipedia" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Galaga</a>(<a href="http://www.free80sarcade.com/galaga.php" title="Play Galaga in your browser!" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">play</a>).</p>
                <p>
                    The game was coded in <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/free-developer-offers/" title="Microsoft Visual Studio Community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Visual Studio</a>, C# using Console functions only.  Graphics are entirely ANSI.</p>
                <p>
                    This app was created for the <a href="https://www.visualstudio.com/free-developer-offers/" title="Milwaukee Area Technical School" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">MATC</a> ITDEV110 course final project.  As this is the only opportunity in the Software Development course I have to develop in C#, my goal was to push what I had learned as far as I could.</p>
                <p>
                    The goal was to simulate a typical 'game' feel in the console similar to DOS games that I played in High School.  From what we had learned in class, player movement would be fairly simple.  Getting the app to function while waiting for the player's Console.KeyPress(), however was the initial hurdle.</p>
                <p>
                    The solution was found outside of class in the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.threading.tasks.task(v=vs.110).aspx" title="System.Threading.Tasks" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Task Class</a>.  Tasks are a way of performing asynchronous operations.  This allowed the app to both wait for user input while continuing to function.</p>
                <p>
                    Additionally, the use of timers utilizing <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/brada/2004/03/20/seconds-since-the-unix-epoch-in-c/" title="Unix Epoch in C#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Unix Epoch</a> in milliseconds were used.  These allowed just about every action in the game to be throttled by having a related timer.  By doing this, I could have complete control over the flow of every element of the game and could adjust it as needed during development or variably within the game during operation.</p>
                <p>
                    Barring the above conventions, everything else that is in this code is what was learned in class.  Movement is displayed using Console.WriteLine() and Console.SetCursorPosition(x, y).  MVC methodology is utilized to setup methods in a logical fashion.</p>
                <p>
                    There is no progression besides Enemy actors being spawned and the eventual player death.  A score is calculated by adding one to a counter value every time a player projectile collides with an Enemy actor.  Once the Player's health reaches 0 the game gives all actor values a 0 to deactivate them, resets all other variables to their original value and returns to the main menu.</p>

                                Player unit.  This is the only actor that doesn't have an array associated with the unit itself.  The player unit moves whenever the arrow keys are pressed in the direction dictated.

                            <p>
                                The directional keys dictate movement, 'Q' fires projectiles and 'Esc' opens the pause menu.
                                The player starts with 100 health.

                                The Enemies in the game are comprised of many parallel arrays.  Their parent array dictates if they're active(1) or not(0) a value greater than 10 means they are a Power-Up actor.<br>
                                Enemies have no health.  They deactivate immediatly on collision with either the Player, another Enemy or a Player Projectile.</p>
                            <p>
                                Their spawn rate fixed at .5 seconds, however this is coded to be easily altered during the game if desired.  Movement speed, direction and shooting frequency is random to give the game a more organic feel.</p>
                            <p>
                                The difficulty setting will give the Enemy projectiles an increased X directional bias toward the Player when the projectile was first shot.</p>

                                Health Power-Up.  If the Player collides with this actor, the Player's Health total will increase by 10 capping at 100.

                                Explosive Shot Power-Up.  If the Player collides with this actor, all enemies will spawn Player Projectiles in a radial pattern around the enemy when a Player Projectile collides with and deactivates an Enemy actor.

                                Spread Shot Power-Up.  If the Player collides with this actor, the Player will spawn two additional Player Projectiles when shooting.  If the Player collides with this actor a second time, two more Player Projectiles will spawn with each shot for a total of five.
                            </p>

                            Once a Player has collected the maximum amount of a Power-Up type, that type will no longer spawn.  For example, if the Player has picked up two Spread Shots and one Explosive Shot, only Health will spawn.
