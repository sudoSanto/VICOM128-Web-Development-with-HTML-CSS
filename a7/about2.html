            Peter Piper built his farm in rural Illinois in 1920, just about 100 years after the fine state of Illinois was founded.  Peter, a young buck at the time, walked into the Illinois land office and paid a mere $150 for the land.  Little did he know, this land was to become legendary throughout the world as the premier spot of the world's finest peppers.
            </p>
            <p>
            In the following years, Peter Piper built his home, plowed the fields and raised a family with his wife, Patricia.  The farm flourished, but was otherwise unheard of until 1933.
            </p>
            <p>
            As the story goes, every day for nearly a year during the Century of Progress, Chicago World's Fair, Peter Piper would ride his horse into town brandishing his peppers, pickled by his wife, Patricia.  Fair-goers went wild for them, spreading his name and his trademark limeric throught the world.

                All of our peppers are grown 100% organic.  Just like grandpa Peter grew them years ago.
